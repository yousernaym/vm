Todo:
- Bump mapping.
- (Fix alpha blending.) Fix line vertices at turns.

Done:
- Use static vertex buffers for bar style.
- Antialiasing through blurring of line edges and mod discarding if FadeOut > 0.
- Add possibility to select notes with non-default camera settings.
- Texture coords (tiled) independent of screen resolution
- Fix update loop
- Option to invert modulation.
- Don't add specular lighting on transparent areas.
- Fix modulation for line style.
- Correct specular lighting when camera moves.
- (Don't clamp brightness before modulating with texture.)
  Added ambient and diffuse amount controls instead. If brightness gets too low because of a texture, you only need to correct with either of these controls instead of having to adjust brightness of both normal and highlighted notes.
- Use shader for bar rendering and add rendering options for bar style (rendering options consist of only the modulation controls desctribed below).
- (Common style parameters: border size, border crossfade size, border color, border shape (round, square))
  Can do the above with the modulation system.
- Specify mixdown name to libmikmod so that different projects can be open at the same time (in multiple instances of Visual Music) with their respective mixdown files.
  (Also put files in separate subfolders of temp folder and have last instance delete everything)
- Point xmplay sid plugin to songlengths.txt.
- Instruct user to browse for C64Music\DOCUMENTS folder
- abcde4.xm contains note's in channel 0 (29/05 -17)
- Mod effects: Pattern loop e6x, pos jump bxx, pattern break dxx, retrig rxy, sample offset 9xx
- Refactor effects. TrackProps has LineStyleEnum to determine line style. NoteStyle_Bar/Line instances contains props and fx.
- Get MonoGame keys to work. (ctrl and shift when selecting notes in SongPanel)
  Switched to winforms onmousedown/up instead.
- Swap r and b channels when rendering video (use bgr rendertarget).

(- Parse songlengths.txt) Not really needed if a very long songlength is specified for note creation and XmPlay is pointed to songlengths.txt. The notes will be cut off when audio ends.
