(- Parse songlengths.txt) Not really needed if a very long songlength is specified for note creation and XmPlay is pointed to songlengths.txt. The notes will be cut off when audio ends.
- Use shader for bar rendering and add rendering options for bar style.
- Don't clamp brightness before modulating with texture.
- Bump mapping.
- Specify mixdown name to libmikmod so that different projects can be open at the same time (in multiple instances of Visual Music) with their respective mixdown files.


Done:
- Point xmplay sid plugin to songlengths.txt.
- Instruct user to browse for C64Music\DOCUMENTS folder
- abcde4.xm contains note's in channel 0 (29/05 -17)
- Mod effects: Pattern loop e6x, pos jump bxx, pattern break dxx, retrig rxy, sample offset 9xx
- Refactor effects. TrackProps has LineStyleEnum to determine line style. NoteStyle_Bar/Line instances contains props and fx.
- Get MonoGame keys to work. (ctrl and shift when selecting notes in SongPanel)
  Switched to winforms onmousedown/up instead.
(- Swap r and b channels in texture sample in shader when rendering video.) Not needed anymore?
