Todo:
- Fix viewport width change for lines
- Keyframe interpolation of all/most properties
- Use hardware tesselation for lines (when Monogame supports it)
- Individual world matrices  for different tracks
- Normal/parallax mapping.
- Increase minimum width for ribbons.
- Make a Point/Dot note style, like Bar but centered on note start. 
  Alternatively make it an option to add points in line style (and optionally make line invisible).
- Use context menus for download links to download songs instead of import, or open import form instead of directly importing.
