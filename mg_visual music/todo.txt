- Use shader for bar rendering and add rendering options for bar style.
- Don't clamp brightness before modulating with texture.
- Bump mapping.

- abcde4.xm contains note's in channel 0
- Parse songlengths.txt and point xmplay sid plugin to same.
- Instruct user to browse for C64Music\DOCUMENTS folder


Done:
- Mod effects: Pattern loop e6x, pos jump bxx, pattern break dxx, retrig rxy, sample offset 9xx
- Refactor effects. TrackProps has LineStyleEnum to determine line style. NoteStyle_Bar/Line instances contains props and fx.
- Get MonoGame keys to work. (ctrl and shift when selecting notes in SongPanel)
  Switched to winforms onmousedown/up instead.
(- Swap r and b channels in texture sample in shader when rendering video.) Not needed anymore?
