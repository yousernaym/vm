Todo:
- Bump mapping.
- Increase minimum width for ribbons.
- Make a Point/Dot note style, like Bar but centered on note start. 
  Alternatively make it an option to add points in line style (and optionally make line invisible).
- Loading of songlengths.txt directly from HVSC.
- Use context menus for download links to download songs instead of import, or open import form instead of directly importing.
  Maybe also add default behaviour setting.
- Let user specify view width in song properties.
